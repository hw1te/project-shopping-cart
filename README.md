## Introduction

This is a **Single Page Application** project where I used **Asynchronous JavaScript**and others concepts like:
- Promises
- Fetch
- API Consumption
- Async
- Await

## How to use ?

After cloning the repository, you should:
- Download the dependencies:
  - `npm install`
  
- Launch your `local development server`, if using VS Code for an example, you can do it using `Live Server`, an extension.

After this simple process you'll be able to visualize it on your browser either trough localhost or network:
